    "ans.  Python is an interpreted programming language, \n",
    "     which supports object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.  What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "ans.   Python programs/scripts are stored in files with .py extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.  Is Python code compiled or interpreted ?\n",
    "ans.   Python code is both compiled and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6.  Name a few block of code  used to define in Python programming language?\n",
    "ans.   In Python, to define a block of code we use indentation. \n",
    "       Indentation refers to whitespaces at the beginning of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.  State a character used to give single-line comments in Python? \n",
    "ans. To write single-line comments in Python use the Hash character\n",
    "     (#) at the beginning of the line. It is also called number sign or pound sign.\n",
    "         \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.  Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on? \n",
    "ans.  The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.  Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called ?\n",
    "Ans.    Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name)\n",
    "        at runtime, using a construct called lambda. Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression.\n",
    "        They can be used wherever normal functions can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What does pip stand for python? \n",
    "ans.   pip is a package manager for python. \n",
    "      Which is also called Preferred Installer Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Mention a few built-in functions in python? \n",
    "ans.  (1) print() : Prints to the standard output device\n",
    "      (2) abs()   : Returns the absolute value of a number\n",
    "      (3) float() : Returns a floating point number\n",
    "      (4) int()   : Returns an integer number\n",
    "      (5) len()   : Returns the length of an object\n",
    "      (6) list()  : Returns a list\n",
    "      (7) map()   : Returns the specified iterator with the specified function applied to each item\n",
    "      (8) str()   : Returns a string object\n",
    "      (9) tuple() : Returns a tuple\n",
    "    (10) sorted() : Returns a sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python? \n",
    "ans.    An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "ans. (1) Third-Party Modules : Python Package Index (PyPI) comprises a multitude of third-party modules \n",
    "         which makes Python integrate with other languages and platforms easily.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     (2) Presence of Libraries : Python is fraught with numerous standard libraries that include string operations,\n",
    "         internet protocols, web service tools, Machine Learning libraries, and operating System Interfaces. \n",
    "         The presence of these libraries essentially helps in reducing the code to be written by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "     (3) Open Source and free : Python is free for use even for commercial purposes.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     (4) Huge Support Community : Due to lack of official technical support for Python\n",
    "         is open-sourced has prompted the development of communities that enrich the resource bank \n",
    "         for continued development and adoption of the language.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     (5) Easy to learn : Python is popular for its excellent readability.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     (6) User-Friendly data structures : With its built-in data structures, \n",
    "         Python can easily construct run-time data structures including Arrays, Lists, tuples, and Files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How is memory managed in Python? \n",
    "ans.     Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. \n",
    "         All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. \n",
    "         This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself,\n",
    "         and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables? \n",
    "ans.  To install Python on Windows, follow the below steps:\n",
    "     . Install python from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "     . After this, install it on your PC. Look for the location where PYTHON has been installed on your PC\n",
    "       using the following command on your command prompt: cmd python. \n",
    "     . Then go to advanced system settings and add a new variable and name it as PYTHON_NAME and paste the copied path.\n",
    "       Look for the path variable, select its value and select ‘edit’.\n",
    "     . Add a semicolon towards the end of the value if it’s not present and then type %PYTHON_HOME% \n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    "Q16. Is indentation required in python? \n",
    "ans. Indentation in Python is compulsory and is part of its syntax.\n",
    "     All programming languages have some way of defining the scope and extent of the block of codes. \n",
    "     In Python, it is indentation. \n",
    "     Indentation provides better readability to the code, which is probably why Python has made it compulsory.\n",
